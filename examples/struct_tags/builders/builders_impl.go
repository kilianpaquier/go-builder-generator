Additional functions present here are called during a specific builder's
Build function in the order of struct fields.

For instance, with the below struct, `some_function` will be called first and
then `some_other_function` will be called.

type MyStruct struct {
    FirstField  string `builder:"default_func=some_function"`
    SecondField string `builder:"default_func=some_other_function"`
}

// some fields of SomeStruct at the end of builder in case those would depend on other fields.
